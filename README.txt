data folder contains all the experiment input data. It is a subset of CASIA V5 dataset.

experiment.ipynb notebook contains the example code and experiment related code for face_recognition and DeepFace SDK.

openFaceTest.py contains the experiment code of OpenFace, the reason why it was writen in a seperated file is that I use the SDK in a Docker container. There's also a command in the file shows how to run it with Docker.

Other files are output of the code files, like DET curves files.
